# lolPing — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-10-01
**Status:** Implemented in v0.1.0; wheel customization (Bait, Vision Cleared, drag-and-drop slots) added in v0.2.1; rooms over LAN added in v0.3.0 (§12); emotes added in v0.5.0 (§13)

## 1. Purpose

A personal desktop toy for Windows that recreates League of Legends' ping wheel anywhere on the desktop. Hold the trigger key (Alt by default), drag, and a League-style ping wheel opens. Release on a slice to drop that ping, with its animation and its original sound, at the point where the wheel opened.

- **Audience:** a single user on their own machine. Since v0.3.0, users on the same network can also join a room and see each other's pings (§12).
- **Capture:** pings must appear in whole-screen capture (Discord "Screen", OBS Display Capture, screenshots). Single-window capture is not supported.
- **Success criteria:**
  1. Alt+drag opens the wheel over any normal app without that app receiving the drag.
  2. Releasing on a slice shows the ping with animation and sound with no noticeable delay.
  3. With the option off, Alt+click behaves as it did without lolPing.
  4. A hotkey turns everything on and off.
  5. The settings UI follows Fluent design.

## 2. Decisions log

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Platform | Windows 11 only, multi-monitor, mixed DPI (user has two displays) |
| Stack | Electron (TypeScript) + React + Fluent UI React v9 for the UI. A small native C++ helper handles global input. |
| Default trigger | Hold **Alt** and drag with the left mouse button to open the wheel. |
| Trigger + click (no drag) | Configurable, **off** by default. Off: the click passes through untouched. On: it places a **generic** ping and the click is swallowed. |
| Toggle | A global hotkey (default **Ctrl+Alt+P**) turns pinging on/off, mirrored in the tray. |
| Wheel slots | 8 slices, top then clockwise. Default: Danger, Push, On My Way, All In, Assist Me, Need Vision, Enemy Missing, Enemy Vision. The user can drag any of the 11 pings onto any slot, and pick the trigger+click ping (default Generic), in settings. |
| Excluded pings | Defend/Hold, Target, the yellow "caution" circle: they need a target, so they wait until lolPing can pick one |
| Textures | Only standard textures. **Never colourblind (`_cb`) variants.** |
| Sound | Original League sounds, extracted from the user's local install |

## 3. Assets

The assets are already extracted into the repo and ship with the app. They come from the user's local League install and are © Riot Games. The project will be published on GitHub with the assets bundled; the owner accepts the risk and will take it down if Riot asks.

### 3.1 Ping table (single source of truth: `src/shared/pings.ts`)

Slot is the default layout (`DEFAULT_WHEEL`); the user can rearrange it.

| id | Slot | Wheel icon (`assets/textures/`) | On-screen art | Sound (`assets/sounds/`) | Ring colour |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `danger` | N | `pingwheel_retreatrender.png` | `pingwheel_retreatrender.png` | `SRP_12.wav` | `#ff3b55` |
| `push` | NE | `push.png` | `pingwheel_pushrender.png` | `SRP_9.wav` | `#35d27a` |
| `omw` | E | `omw.png` | `omw.png` (upright icon; the flat `omw` ground render looks wrong) | `OnMyWay.wav` | `#2e8bff` |
| `allin` | SE | `all_in.png` | `pingwheel_allin_render_01.png` + `_02.png` (two halves that clash together) | `SRP_4.wav` | `#f2b320` |
| `assist` | S | `assist_me.png` | `assist_me.png` | `ComeHere.wav` | `#56d43c` |
| `needvision` | SW | `need_vision.png` | `need_vision.png` | `SRP_7.wav` | `#56d43c` |
| `missing` | W | `enemy_missing.png` | `enemy_missing.png` | `MIA.wav` | `#f2c518` |
| `enemyvision` | NW | `enemy_vision.png` | `pingwheel_enemyvisionrender.png` | `AreaIsWarded.wav` | `#ff3b55` |
| `generic` | (trigger+click) | `generic_ping.png` | `pingwheel_basicpingrender.png` | `Base.wav` | `#2e8bff` |
| `bait` | — | `pingwheel_baitrender.png` | `pingwheel_baitrender.png` (the hook; also used as the icon) | `SRP_11.wav` | `#efbc12` |
| `visioncleared` | — | `vision_cleared.png` | `pingwheel_visionclearedrender.png` | `SRP_6.wav` | `#2b80ff` |
| wheel tick | — | — | — | `button.wav` | — |

Unused extracted files stay in `assets/` but are never referenced: the `_cb` textures, `caution`, `hold`, `target`, the `pingwheel_*` renders not listed above, and the other sounds (`SRP_13.wav` is the structure-defend ping).

### 3.2 Asset pipeline (already run; kept reproducible)

The extraction scripts live in `tools/extract-assets/`, together with a README. Each step:

1. **Textures:** DDS (DXT5) → PNG with Pillow. Bait and Vision Cleared come straight from League's `.tex` files in `Global.wad.client` (`--wad-textures`).
   No game file maps those two pings to their sounds; `SRP_11` (Bait) and `SRP_6` (Vision Cleared) were identified by ear.
2. **Sound banks:** read the WAD v3 table of contents with a small Python reader (Python 3.14 has built-in zstd). Names come from CommunityDragon's `hashes.game.txt` list, filtered to sound banks. The ping banks are in `DATA/FINAL/Maps/Shipping/Common.wad.client`:
   - `assets/sounds/wwise2016/sfx/shared/hud_global_events.bnk`
   - `assets/sounds/wwise2016/sfx/shared/hud_global_audio.bnk`
3. **Event → clip mapping:**
   - Event names (`Play_sfx_hud_base_Pings_*`) come from string search in the game's `.bin` files.
   - The bank's HIRC section is walked from event → action → layer container → sound → embedded WEM id.
   - The event id is the FNV-1 32-bit hash of the lower-cased event name.
4. **Decoding:** the clips are Wwise Vorbis (`0xFFFF`), decoded with `vgmstream-cli` (r2117).
5. **Mixing:** layer containers play their children at the same time. They are mixed with ffmpeg `amix` plus `alimiter` (limit −1 dB) to avoid clipping. Each file has at most 35 ms of silence at the start.

## 4. Architecture

```

**Why a separate helper process:**
- Only a low-level hook can swallow the Alt+drag so the app underneath doesn't drag or select text. Node global-hook libraries can only listen.
- Windows silently removes a low-level hook that responds slowly, so it can't live on Electron's busy main thread.
- A tiny dedicated process responds in microseconds and is isolated from renderer and GC pauses.

## 5. Hook helper

### 5.1 Input decision logic (pure, unit-tested state machine in `decision.cpp`)

States: `Idle`, `Pending` (trigger held + button down, not yet moved past the threshold), `Wheel` (wheel open).

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Disabled | Pass everything through; only the toggle hotkey is checked |
| Left button down while trigger held | **Swallow**, record the point, go to `Pending` |
| `Pending`, movement > `dragThresholdPx` | Send `wheelOpen{x,y}` with the *press* point, go to `Wheel` |
| `Wheel`, mouse move | Send `wheelMove{x,y}`. Movement is not swallowed, so the cursor still moves. |
| `Wheel`, left button up | **Swallow**, send `wheelRelease{x,y}`, go to `Idle` |
| `Pending`, left button up (trigger+click) | Option on: **swallow**, send `click{x,y}`. Option off: **replay** the down+up with `SendInput` (flagged as injected so the helper ignores its own events). Back to `Idle`. |
| `Wheel`, right button down or Esc | **Swallow**, send `cancel`, go to `Idle` |
| Trigger released during `Pending` | Treat as a plain click: replay it (or ping, if the option is on) |
| Trigger released during `Wheel` | Send `cancel`, go to `Idle` (the matching button up will still be swallowed) |
| Toggle hotkey | **Swallow**, flip enabled, send `toggled{enabled}`. If disabled mid-drag, also send `cancel`. |
| Watchdog: no mouse event for 10 s while in `Wheel` or `Pending` | Send `cancel`, go to `Idle` |

**Invariant:** for every swallowed button down, the paired up is also swallowed, or both are replayed. An app never sees an unmatched press.

### 5.2 Modifier side effects

- **Alt / Win menu activation.** Windows opens the menu bar (Alt) or Start menu (Win) when the key goes up without any other key in between. When a wheel or ping happened while the modifier was held, the helper injects a no-op "mask" key (`VK_NONAME`, 0xFC) before the modifier's key-up. AutoHotkey uses the same trick.
- **Caps Lock or a custom key as trigger:** that key's down/up is swallowed, so Caps state doesn't change and no character is typed.
- **Mouse 4 / Mouse 5 as trigger:** the side button itself is the drag button (press side button, move, release). A side-button click without movement is replayed so browser Back/Forward still works, or it pings if the trigger+click option is on.

### 5.3 Protocol (JSON lines, defined once in `src/shared/protocol.ts`, mirrored in C++)

All coordinates are **physical screen pixels**.

- **Electron → helper (stdin):** one *flat* JSON object per line (the helper's tiny parser accepts no nesting).
  - `{"type":"config","trigger":"alt"|"ctrl"|"shift"|"win"|"capslock"|"mouse4"|"mouse5"|"vk","triggerVk":N,"clickPing":bool,"dragThresholdPx":N,"toggleMods":N,"toggleVk":N,"enabled":bool}`
    - `toggleMods` is a bitmask: Ctrl = 1, Alt = 2, Shift = 4, Win = 8. `triggerVk` is used only when `trigger` is `"vk"` (custom key).
  - `{"type":"setEnabled","enabled":bool}`
  - `{"type":"suspend","on":bool}`: while the settings window is capturing a new shortcut, pass all input through and ignore the toggle hotkey.
  - `{"type":"shutdown"}`
  - Test mode only (`hook-helper.exe --simulate`, no OS hooks): `{"type":"sim","ev":"mdown"|"mup"|"move"|"kdown"|"kup"|"tick","btn":"left"|"right"|"middle"|"x1"|"x2","x":N,"y":N,"vk":N,"t":ms,"self":bool}`. After each one the helper also prints `{"type":"sim","swallow":bool,"inject":"down:left,up:left,…"}`.
- **Helper → Electron (stdout):**
  - `{"type":"ready","version":1}`
  - `{"type":"wheelOpen","x":N,"y":N}`, `{"type":"wheelMove","x":N,"y":N}`, `{"type":"wheelRelease","x":N,"y":N}`
  - `{"type":"click","x":N,"y":N}`, `{"type":"cancel"}`, `{"type":"toggled","enabled":bool}`
  - `{"type":"error","message":"..."}`, e.g. a hotkey conflict, so the UI can report it
- **Lifetime:** if stdin closes (EOF), meaning Electron died, the helper removes its hooks and exits. The helper never outlives the app.

## 6. Electron main process

- **Single instance:** a second launch opens the settings window instead.
- **InputBridge:**
  - Spawns `hook-helper.exe` (bundled via electron-builder `extraResources`), parses its JSON lines, and sends `config` on start and on every settings change.
  - Restarts the helper with backoff (0.5 s, 1 s, 2 s). After 3 crashes within 60 s, it stops, sets the tray to a warning state and shows a toast.
- **OverlayManager:**
  - One `BrowserWindow` per display: `transparent`, `frame:false`, `focusable:false`, `skipTaskbar`, `alwaysOnTop` at level `screen-saver`, `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true)`, created with `showInactive()`.
  - Windows exactly cover each display's `bounds`. They are rebuilt on `display-added`, `display-removed` and `display-metrics-changed`.
  - Each event is routed to the overlay whose display contains the press point. A wheel near a screen edge may be clipped; it is not clamped, the same as in League.
- **Coordinates:** `screen.screenToDipPoint({x,y})` converts physical pixels to DIP, then the display's DIP origin is subtracted to get overlay-local CSS pixels. Wheel moves are converted relative to the *wheel's* display, even when the cursor crosses onto another monitor.
- **Toggle feedback:** tray icon state (normal or dimmed), the tray menu checkbox, and a small Fluent toast saying "Pings on" or "Pings off".
- **Startup:** "Launch at Windows startup" uses `app.setLoginItemSettings` with the argument `--hidden`. A manual launch opens the settings window; a `--hidden` launch stays in the tray.

## 7. Overlay renderer

### 7.1 Wheel (matches the in-game reference screenshot and `prototype/wheel-demo.html`)

**Geometry:** SVG centered on the press point.

| Part | Size / style |
|---|---|
| Center disc | radius 86 px, teal radial gradient, 3 px gold ring `#c8aa6e` |
| Ring | 8 wedges from radius 86 to 188 |
| Cardinal wedges (N/E/S/W) | extend to radius 288 with a fading gradient |
| Wedge dividers | thin gold-tinted lines |

- **Slots:** each slice shows the ping from the `wheel` setting; the overlay redraws the icons when it changes.
- **Center content:** the generic-ping icon, a "PING" label in `#1fa9e0`, and a dim "BACK" hint with a right-click mouse glyph.
- **Icons:** 48 px at radius 137. Idle icons are desaturated gold (`grayscale(1) sepia(.75) saturate(1.3) brightness(1.15)`). The hovered slice shows the full-colour icon at 1.18× scale and a brightened wedge.
- **Selection:**
  - The slice is picked from the angle between the press point and the cursor, in 45° sectors centered on N, NE, …
  - A distance under 86 px means nothing is selected; releasing there cancels.
  - Moving onto a new slice plays `button.wav` at low volume, if the tick sound is enabled.
- **Animation:** opens with fade + scale 0.85 → 1 over 120 ms, closes with a fade.

### 7.2 Ping animation (as in the prototype)

The default duration is 3.2 s and scales with the "ping duration" setting. The art is drawn at "ping size" (default 110 px) and anchored so the ground ellipse sits on the press point.

1. **Pop:** scale 0.4 → 1.15 → 1.0 and fade in over 280 ms with an overshoot ease.
2. **Rings:** coloured rings expand 0.25× → 1.35× and fade over 650 ms, at 0, 220 ms and 1.4 s.
3. **Hold:** a gentle 5 px bob on a 1.6 s cycle, a coloured glow drop-shadow, and a soft coloured ground ellipse.
4. **Fade out** over the last ~13% of the duration, then the element is removed.
5. **All In:** the two halves slide in from opposite diagonals over 220 ms, then a white-to-colour flash and a 250 ms shake, then the bob.

Several pings can be on screen at once, and each is independent.

### 7.3 Audio

- **Decoding:** all ping and tick sounds are decoded once into `AudioBuffer`s at overlay load, with `AudioContext({latencyHint:'interactive'})`.
- **Playback:** each play is a fresh `AudioBufferSource` → `GainNode` (volume from settings). This removed the noticeable delay heard with `HTMLAudioElement` in the prototype.
- **Autoplay:** Electron's `autoplayPolicy: 'no-user-gesture-required'` keeps the context running without a user gesture.
- **No double sounds:** only the overlay that renders a ping plays its sound.

## 8. Settings

### 8.1 Schema (`src/shared/settings.ts`, versioned)

| Key | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | number | 1 |
| `enabledOnStart` | bool | true |
| `trigger` | `alt`/`ctrl`/`shift`/`win`/`capslock`/`mouse4`/`mouse5`/`{vk}` | `alt` |
| `dragThresholdPx` | 2–40 | 8 |
| `clickPing` | bool | false |
| `clickPingId` | ping id | `generic` |
| `wheel` | 8 distinct ping ids, top then clockwise | `DEFAULT_WHEEL` (an invalid list resets to it) |
| `toggleHotkey` | `{mods, vk}` | Ctrl+Alt+P |
| `pingSizePx` | 60–220 | 110 |
| `pingDurationS` | 1.0–8.0 | 3.2 |
| `volume` | 0–100 | 70 |
| `muted` | bool | false |
| `tickSound` | bool | true |
| `launchAtStartup` | bool | false |

Changes apply live, with no Save button. Writes are debounced (300 ms) and atomic (write a temp file, then rename).

### 8.2 Settings window (matches `prototype/settings-demo.html`)

- **Window:** Fluent UI React v9 components, `backgroundMaterial: 'mica'`, theme follows Windows light/dark, Windows 11 caption buttons, left navigation (Trigger, Toggle, Pings & sound, Wheel, App), Windows 11 Settings–style cards.
- **Status card:** at the top, a master on/off switch with a live hint ("Hold Alt and drag… · Ctrl + Alt + P to turn off"). Turning it off dims the dependent cards.
- **Trigger key:** a Fluent `Dropdown`, *not* a native select, with Keyboard and Mouse option groups plus "Custom key…", which captures the next key press.
- **Toggle shortcut:** a key-capture field showing keycaps. Click it, press a combination, and it rebinds; Esc cancels. A conflict reported by the helper shows inline and keeps the old binding.
- **Sliders:** drag distance, ping size, ping duration, volume. **Switches:** trigger+click ping, start enabled, tick sound, launch at startup.
- **Wheel** (matches `prototype/wheel-editor-demo.html`): a small wheel with the 8 slots and the trigger+click ping in the centre, beside a tile per ping (no `_cb` textures).
  - Clicking a tile previews it: plays its sound and spawns it at the center of the primary display.
  - Drag a tile onto a slot to put it there; a ping already on the wheel swaps places instead, so no ping appears twice. Drag a slot onto another to swap them. Drop on the centre to set the click ping.
  - Without dragging: click a tile or slot, then click where it goes. Esc cancels. "Reset to default" restores `DEFAULT_WHEEL` and Generic.
  - The rules live in `src/shared/wheelLayout.ts` as pure functions.
- **About:** version, asset notice, known limitations, asset problems, and "Open settings folder".

### 8.3 Tray

- **Left-click:** opens the settings.
- **Right-click menu:** Enabled ✓ / Settings… / Quit.
- **Icon states:** normal, dimmed (disabled), warning (helper failed).

## 9. Error handling

| Failure | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Helper crashes or exits | Restart with backoff. After 3 in 60 s: stop, warning tray icon, toast, pinging paused until re-enabled. |
| Electron hangs or dies | The helper sees stdin EOF, unhooks and exits, so input is never left captured. |
| Stuck drag | 10 s watchdog in the helper sends `cancel`. Swallowed downs and ups are always paired. |
| Missing or undecodable sound | That ping is silent; logged and listed in About. |
| Missing texture | Fall back to `generic_ping.png`; logged and listed in About. |
| Corrupt `settings.json` | Back it up as `settings.bak.json` and use defaults. |
| Toggle hotkey conflict | Inline error in the settings; previous binding kept. |
| Display change | Overlays rebuilt; an active wheel is cancelled. |

**Known limitations** (listed in About):
- Elevated (admin) windows such as Task Manager don't receive the hook, because Windows blocks it, so the wheel can't be triggered over them.
- Exclusive-fullscreen games draw above the overlay.
- Single-window screen capture doesn't include the overlay.

## 10. Testing

- **Vitest (TypeScript):**
  - slice picking (sector boundaries at ±22.5°, dead-zone at 86 px, angle wrap)
  - coordinate conversion across two displays with different scale factors
  - settings defaults, clamping, migration, and corrupt-file fallback
  - ping table integrity: every referenced asset file exists, no `_cb` file is referenced
  - protocol message parsing
- **C++ unit tests** for `decision.cpp` (no OS hooks), as table-driven event sequences:
  - drag opens the wheel
  - click with the option on and off
  - trigger released early
  - right-click / Esc cancel
  - toggle mid-drag
  - watchdog
  - mask key emitted for Alt/Win
  - injected events ignored
- **Protocol integration test:** spawn the real `hook-helper.exe` in a test mode that reads simulated input events from stdin instead of installing hooks, and assert the JSON output.
- **Manual checklist** before calling v1 done:
  - Alt+drag over Chrome, Explorer, VS Code and Discord, with no text selection or menu bar activation
  - Alt+click with the option on and off
  - toggle hotkey while idle and mid-drag
  - both monitors at their real scale factors
  - pings visible in Discord "Screen" share and OBS Display Capture
  - kill the helper → it auto-restarts
  - kill Electron → mouse and keyboard are normal

## 11. Out of scope for v1

Multiplayer/sync (rooms arrived in v0.3.0, §12), rebinding wheel slots, colourblind texture sets, per-ping volume, macOS/Linux, ping spam throttling, and a minimap.

macOS support was added in v0.2.0; see [design-macos.md](design-macos.md).

## 12. Rooms (v0.3.0, internet in v0.4.0)

Full design: [superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-room-ping-sharing-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-room-ping-sharing-design.md). In short:

- **Model:** a room is a code, `PING-XXXXX-XXXXX` (Crockford base32, 9 random characters + a Luhn mod 32 check character, `src/shared/roomCode.ts`). Parsing ranks candidates and never glues neighbouring words onto a code; clipboard reads are strict. Every finished ping (wheel or trigger+click, never a settings preview) goes to every member; up to 8 members.
- **Crypto (`src/main/roomCrypto.ts`):** scrypt(code) → HKDF → AES-256-GCM. Each packet is `[0x01][nonce][ciphertext+tag]`, at most 1200 bytes. Keys never leave the main process.
- **Messages (`src/shared/roomProtocol.ts`):** `presence` (name, tag colour, `on`/`paused`/`muted`, protocol and app version), `ping` (ping id, display number, x/y as 0–1 fractions), `bye`. Everything is validated field by field; names are stripped of control and bidi characters and shown with `textContent`. A per-peer sequence window plus a ±10 min timestamp check rejects replays. Packets outside that window never touch the member list; they only raise a "clock more than 10 minutes off" hint. The peer ID is random per join, because a peer that said bye stays rejected for the receiver's session.
- **RoomManager (`src/main/roomManager.ts`):** members, path choice (LAN while alive, else internet), the incoming rate limit (per member, user setting 1–20/s or unlimited), mute (room and per person), timeouts (LAN path alive 6 s and member dropped after 15 s; internet path alive 25 s and member dropped after 30 s), "room is full" 3 s after the relays answer (at most 15 s). It only talks to the network through the `Transport` interface (`src/main/transport.ts`); a `shared` transport gets each packet once, pings over it are capped at 5/s (bursts of 10), and presence at once a second.
- **LAN transport (`src/main/lanTransport.ts`):** one UDP socket on port 47474. Presence is broadcast every 2 s to 255.255.255.255 and each interface's directed broadcast; pings go unicast to the address a member's packets come from. Before decryption, a flood guard allows 100 packets/s per source IP and 800/s in total, and tracks at most 1024 addresses. The socket is re-bound after sleep.
- **Mapping:** displays are numbered #1 = primary, then left→right, top→bottom (`src/main/displayNumbers.ts`). A ping lands on the receiver's display with the same number, or #1, at the same fraction of its size. `resolveTarget` is the hook a later share-window mode replaces.
- **Overlay:** wheel pings are reported back to main (`overlay:pinged`); remote pings carry a name tag. Safety ceiling: 60 pings on screen, 8 overlapping sounds.
- **Relay transport (v0.4.0, `src/main/relayTransport.ts`):** full design in [superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-internet-rooms-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-internet-rooms-design.md). Each sealed packet becomes one ephemeral Nostr event (kind 24747, tag `x` = a topic derived from the code, base64 content), signed with a key made fresh on every join (`src/main/nostrEvent.ts`), and published to every live relay in `src/main/relays.ts`. No WebRTC and no server of our own; members never see each other's IP over it.
  - `RelayPool` drops copies by event id and caps intake at 200 events/s. `RelayConnection` judges each relay by our own events coming back: no echo for 25 s means down and a reconnect with backoff (2 s → 60 s); `rate-limited` cools it for 30 s; `blocked`/`restricted`/`auth-required`/`pow`/`invalid`, a message over 64 KB or over 400 messages/s retire it for the session.
  - Status is `ok` while any relay echoes, `unavailable` after 15 s without one (the Room page then offers Retry). "Allow internet connections" off means no relay is contacted; turning it off mid-room sends no bye.
  - The relay list came from `tools/relay-probe`. Any later list must keep at least 3 of the previous one, or old and new versions can't meet. Development builds read `LOLPING_RELAYS` instead.


## 13. Emotes (v0.5.0)

Full design: [superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-emotes-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-emotes-design.md). In short: a second wheel, opened by its own key, places a League emote (a short animation and a sound) the way a ping is placed, and rooms carry it like a ping.

- **Helper, two triggers:** `config` gains `emoteTrigger` (a trigger name or `"off"`), `emoteTriggerVk` and `emoteClick`, and the helper's `ready` version becomes 2. Every `wheelOpen`, `wheelMove`, `wheelRelease` and `click` event carries `wheel`: `"ping"` or `"emote"` (a missing field means `"ping"`, so an older helper still works). A press that both triggers claim, such as Alt and Ctrl held together, is ambiguous and passes through untouched. The emote key defaults to Ctrl, so Ctrl + drag no longer reaches the app underneath while lolPing is on; that is listed under known limitations in the README. It can't be the ping trigger (Caps Lock counts as one key however it was picked) or the pause shortcut's key; a settings file edited by hand into a clash turns the emote key off and shows a problem in About.
- **Settings:** `emoteTrigger` (default `ctrl`), `emoteClick` (false), `emoteWheel` (8 distinct emote refs, top then clockwise), `clickEmoteId`, `emoteSizePx` (80–300, default 150), `emoteSound` (true) and `customEmotes` (at most 24). An emote ref is a bundled slug or `c:` plus the 32 hex characters of an imported image's hash. The ping and emote wheels share one generic `WheelEditor` in the settings window.
- **Overlay:** the emote wheel is a second copy of the wheel's SVG with its own centre label. `EmoteStage` (`src/renderer/overlay/emoteFx.ts`) shows the emotes: at most one per owner (`self`, `preview` or a room member's peer ID), each for 3 s. A bundled emote's animated WebP plays once and Chromium gives images with the same URL one shared clock, so the stage fetches each file as a Blob once and gives every spawn its own object URL, revoked when the emote ends. A new emote from an owner replaces their old one on every display: main sends `emote:clear` to the other overlays. Main works out what an emote looks like (`resolveEmoteArt`): bundled, a custom image, or the "?" placeholder for a custom emote whose files are missing here, and the overlay trusts that.
- **`lolping://emotes/<hash>.webp` and `.anim`:** the custom protocol (`src/main/appProtocol.ts`) serves imported emotes from `<settings folder>/emotes`, in development too. It only answers those two names for a 32-hex hash, never caches (an image can be removed and imported again under the same name), and gives the still when the animation is gone.
- **Imported emotes (`src/main/emoteLibrary.ts`):** the settings window turns a file into a still of at most 12,288 bytes and 160 px on its longest side (128 px as a fallback), and keeps the original GIF or WebP when it is at most 5 MB and 1024 px. Main checks it all again and names the emote by the SHA-256 of the still. Files are written through temporary names and renamed together, so a failed import leaves nothing behind.
- **Rooms (`emote` message):** same fields as a ping with an emote ref in place of the ping ID. It follows a ping's routes and checks (paused, room and member mute, update needed, display number), the same incoming limit per member, and over relays the same 5/s, burst-of-10 cap, which pings and emotes share. An unknown but well-formed ref is accepted and shows the placeholder. Members whose presence says an app older than 0.5.0 are marked "Can't see emotes, needs an update". In this version friends see your own images as the placeholder.
- **Baker:** `tools/extract-assets/emote_bake.py` (run with `--emotes`) reads League's emote effect files and bakes each emote at 30 fps on a 320 × 320 canvas holding 256 px of art, as a 3 s animated WebP (quality 80, played once), with an icon PNG and an Opus `.ogg` sound at 96 kbps. It also writes `src/shared/emoteCatalog.ts`, the single list of bundled emotes, and the build leaves out any emote file that list doesn't name.
